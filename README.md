A simple plugin that sets bots to least used survivor character when spawned from(0-7).
Made this plugin last year but zoey windows was broken so never released until now.

[CODE]
[B][U]Few notes:[/U][/B]
This plugin assumes you are using "survivor_set" "2" and will not workaround if not 2.
however you don't have to it just wont work correctly.

[B]Optional Setting survivor_set 2 with vpk[/B]
I'v included vpk(7z attachment) for all valve maps that sets the "survivor_set" to "2"
This method would require you to set them all your self in mission.txt file per addon.
